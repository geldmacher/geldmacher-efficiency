# Efficiency

Internal Cursor cost controls for agent work: RTK-backed shell usage, semantically dense communication, targeted context, bounded validation, context optimization, and evidence-based efficiency review.

The plugin treats efficiency as net savings: reduced shell, communication, and context tokens minus the context, validation, and reviewer overhead introduced by the plugin itself. It does not ship telemetry, persist project metrics, or replace task workflow guidance. Session compaction captures verified state only; it does not plan or assign work.

## Compatibility

| Component | Supported baseline |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor | 3.10.20 tested; older versions are best effort |
| RTK | 0.43.0 or newer |
| Development | Node.js 22 |
| Platforms | macOS, Linux, and WSL |

Native Windows can run RTK commands and filters, but transparent Cursor rewriting requires the Unix hook environment provided by WSL.

## Installation

Clone the repository directly into Cursor's local plugin directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:geldmacher/efficiency.git ~/.cursor/plugins/local/geldmacher-efficiency
```

For development, keep the repository elsewhere and link it into `~/.cursor/plugins/local/geldmacher-efficiency`. After installation or updates, run `Developer: Reload Window` or fully restart Cursor.

If the plugin or its commands are missing, verify that Cursor's setting for third-party plugins, skills, and other agent configurations is enabled.

## Usage

1. Run `/setup-rtk` once per machine. It verifies the correct RTK binary, inspects the existing Cursor hook, previews changes, and requires confirmation before global setup.
2. Run `/create-rtk-filter` for project-specific `.rtk/filters.toml` coverage, especially DDEV command wrappers.
3. Run `/cost-budget` when a task needs explicit context, communication, command, dry-run, validation, and stop limits.
4. Run `/compact-session` when conversation history is oversized, then continue in a fresh Cursor task with its verified state snapshot.
5. Run `/plan-context-optimization` with Cursor Context Usage Analysis data to prepare a readonly optimization plan.
6. Run `/execute-context-optimization` only after approving a concrete plan.
7. Run `/efficiency-review` after meaningful work to assess RTK savings, context and communication discipline, validation economy, and reviewer overhead.

Commands are the user-facing slash-command surface. Skills contain the detailed reusable workflows. Readonly agents are delegated only when fixed complexity thresholds justify the additional model call.

## Cost measurement

The plugin uses this project-scoped RTK snapshot:

```bash
rtk gain --project --format json
```

It reports command count, input and output tokens, saved tokens, and average savings percentage. These are cumulative project values. A task delta is reported only when `/cost-budget` captured a baseline earlier in the same task.

`rtk discover` and `rtk session` are not used as Cursor metrics because they currently inspect Claude Code history. Monetary cost is calculated only when the user provides model-specific input and output token prices.

## Components

- **Commands**: `/setup-rtk`, `/create-rtk-filter`, `/cost-budget`, `/compact-session`, `/plan-context-optimization`, `/execute-context-optimization`, `/efficiency-review`.
- **Skills**: `rtk-cursor-setup`, `project-rtk-filter`, `cost-reduction`, `session-context-compaction`, `context-usage-optimizer`, `efficiency-review`.
- **Agents**: `efficiency-reviewer`, `rtk-filter-reviewer`, and `context-optimization-reviewer` for threshold-based readonly review.
- **Rules**: a small always-on `cursor-efficiency` core, conditional `rtk-filter-maintenance`, and file-scoped `context-optimization-safety`.

## RTK safety

`/setup-rtk` runs `rtk gain` to distinguish Rust Token Killer from the unrelated binary with the same name. It inspects `rtk init --show`, runs `rtk init --global --agent cursor --dry-run -v`, and requires explicit confirmation before applying or uninstalling global integration.

Project filters must pass:

```bash
rtk verify --require-all
```

Warnings that untrusted project filters were skipped mean validation is incomplete. The user must run `rtk trust` from the project root before verification is retried.

## Development

Install the pinned development dependencies and run each gate:

```bash
npm ci
npm run validate
npm test
npm run context-budget
```

The validator uses a pinned copy of Cursor's official plugin schema plus semantic component checks. The context budget estimates tokens with `characters / 4` and enforces:

- always-on rules: at most 250 tokens
- discoverability metadata: at most 250 tokens
- total plugin baseline: at most 500 tokens

For v0.5, the measured baseline is 436 tokens: 206 always-on and 230 discoverability tokens. Semantic communication adds no recurring tokens over the pre-change baseline, and session compaction is unavailable to automatic model invocation.

Before tagging a release, complete [the manual Cursor release checklist](docs/release-checklist.md). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

This repository does not need an `AGENTS.md`: Cursor discovers the plugin's declared commands, skills, agents, and rules directly from `plugin.json`.

## Troubleshooting

- **`rtk gain` is not recognized:** another package named `rtk` is installed. Follow the official RTK installation guide.
- **Cursor hook is missing:** run `rtk init --show`; `/setup-rtk` can preview the supported installation.
- **Plugin is not visible:** confirm the local plugin path, enable third-party agent configurations, and reload Cursor.
- **Filters are skipped as untrusted:** run `rtk trust` manually from the project root, then rerun `rtk verify --require-all`.
- **Native Windows hook is missing:** use Cursor and RTK inside WSL for transparent rewriting.
