description: Create or update project-specific RTK TOML filters by inventorying local commands, especially DDEV wrappers, and adding tested filters for noisy finite commands.

# Project RTK Filter

## Goal

Create or update a project's `.rtk/filters.toml` so project-specific commands produce compact, useful output when RTK wraps shell execution.

Use this when the user asks for RTK filters, DDEV filtering, command-output compaction, or project-local RTK integration.

## Safety

- Do not install RTK, run global RTK setup, or mutate global Cursor config unless the user explicitly asks.
- Preserve existing filters and tests unless they are clearly wrong.
- Do not create filters for long-running dev servers, watchers, shells, SSH sessions, `tail -f`, or interactive commands.
- Prefer project-local `.rtk/filters.toml`; do not put project command knowledge into global RTK config by default.
- If a command handles secrets or production logs, filter noise only; never add examples that contain real secrets, tokens, prompts, or customer data.

## Command Inventory

Find commands that are specific to the current project before writing filters:

1. Read the project entrypoints and command docs, such as `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/**`, `.github/workflows/**`, `.ddev/**`, `Makefile`, `package.json`, `composer.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Taskfile.yml`, and scripts under `bin/` or `scripts/`.
2. Identify commands agents are expected to run often: checks, tests, linting, builds, evaluations, docs gates, generators, cache maintenance, and CLI wrappers.
3. For DDEV projects, prefer matching the outer `ddev ...` command instead of host-level package-manager commands. Include common shapes such as:
   - `ddev check`
   - `ddev <custom-command>`
   - `ddev exec "cd <subdir> && <tool> ..."`
4. Separate finite commands from long-running commands. Filter only finite commands.
5. Group commands by output shape, not by implementation technology. Example groups: full project gates, backend tests, frontend tests, docs/licensing, evaluations, maintenance, generic `ddev exec`.

## Filter Design

For each group:

- Use a precise `match_command` regex that catches documented command variants without catching unrelated commands.
- Enable `strip_ansi = true`.
- Set `filter_stderr = true` for tools that print useful diagnostics to stderr.
- Strip blank lines and known boilerplate only when failures and warnings remain visible.
- Keep enough head and tail output to diagnose failures.
- Add `on_empty` so a fully-filtered success is still understandable.
- Add at least one inline `[[tests.<filter-name>]]` fixture that proves important diagnostics survive filtering.

Use this minimal shape for new project filters, replacing the name, regex, examples, and success message with project-specific values:

```toml
[filters.project_check]
description = "Compact project check output"
match_command = "^ddev\\s+check\\b"
strip_ansi = true
filter_stderr = true
on_empty = "ddev check: ok"

[[tests.project_check]]
name = "keeps failures"
input = "ERROR tests/ExampleTest.php failed"
expected = "ERROR tests/ExampleTest.php failed"
```

Prefer conservative filters:

- Keep `FAIL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, stack traces, assertion messages, file paths, command summaries, and non-zero-exit diagnostics.
- Avoid stripping broad words like `warning`, `failed`, `error`, `exception`, `request_id`, `trace`, or `deprecated` unless the project has a specific noisy line that is safe to remove.
- Do not collapse domain-specific evidence needed for debugging.

## Verification

Use the cheapest available checks:

1. Validate TOML syntax and RTK filter tests with `rtk verify` when available.
2. If `rtk verify` warns that project filters were skipped, such as `untrusted project filters skipped`, do not report project-filter validation as passed.
3. If project-local filters require trust, tell the user to run `rtk trust` from the project root instead of doing it silently, then rerun `rtk verify`.
4. Smoke-test representative commands through RTK only when they are finite and safe.
5. For DDEV commands, avoid starting duplicate dev servers. Prefer documented finite gates and small `ddev exec` smoke commands.
6. Report any RTK-version limitation, such as a local version that can execute filters through `rtk <command>` but cannot rewrite TOML-only commands through the Cursor hook.

## Output

When planning, list:

- discovered project command groups
- filters to create or update
- commands intentionally excluded and why
- verification commands
- any `rtk trust` or version requirement the user must handle

When implementing, keep the diff limited to `.rtk/filters.toml` and directly related docs unless the user asks for broader setup.
